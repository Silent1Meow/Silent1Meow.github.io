            <p>
                Hey there! I am a 3D artist with a focus on making stunning video game art.
                <br>
                <br>
                I started as a 3D artist in late 2021 when I discovered Source Filmmaker. 
                <br>
                I was excited to start using it and was happy with the results but found the limits very quickly.
                <br>
                Shortly after, I transitioned to Blender, where I further honed my skills and pushed my creativity to new heights.
                <br>
                <br>
                In February of 2022, I discovered Substance Painter and loved the software's ability to create intricate and detailed textures. Since then, it has become an a part of my workflow, and I use it to add depth and realism to retextures of 3D models.
                <br>
                <br>
                In addition to my passion for 3D art, I am also deeply interested in the technical side of things. 
                <br>
                I enjoy learning about new software, tools, and techniques that can enhance my workflow and improve the quality of my work. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I am always pushing myself to experiment with new ideas and approaches, and I am not afraid to take on challenging projects that push the boundaries of what I can do.
                <br>
                Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me and my passion for 3D art. If you have any questions or would like to commission a render, don't hesitate to <a href = "https://twitter.com/Silent1Meow" target="_blank">reach out!</a>
